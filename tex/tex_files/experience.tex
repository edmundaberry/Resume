\section{Experience}
\cventry{2014-Present}{Postdoctoral research associate on the CMS experiment}{Brown University}{Providence, RI}{}{I am based in Geneva, Switzerland, where I am a key member of the CMS experiment: a collaboration of over 3,500 physicists studying high energy particle collisions at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).\newline{}%
  Detailed achievements:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Supervisor: Dr. Greg Landsberg
  \item Data analysis leader
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Primary author and analyst of multiple searches for first generation leptoquarks: 
      subatomic particles whose existence is predicted by some theories, but which have not yet been observed. 
    \item Lead extensive data analysis with a team of physicists
    \item Edited and defended publication drafts during several stages of peer review
    \end{itemize}
  \item Data analysis software developer
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Lead developer and administrator of analysis code used by several different searches for exotic particles at CERN
      \item Developing and testing code (C++ and Python) with frequent and timely updates, in order to keep up with changing data-taking conditions
    \end{itemize}
  \item Detector group leader
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Leader of a team of physicists working in the ``HCAL Prompt Feedback Group''
      \item Working with a team to deliver quick solutions to problems affecting an essential detector subsystem
      \item Preparing the CMS experiment for data taking in 2015
    \end{itemize}
  \item Reviewer of physics analyses
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Invited to critically review several measurements and a search for exotic particles
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
